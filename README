Tie::Constrained -- Automatically pre-validate changes to a variable.

Tie::Constrained is a simple class which causes every mutator operation
to a tied variable to be validated before the variable is changed.
That is done in the TIESCALAR and STORE methods, which highjack initialization, assignment and mutator operations.
When tied to a variable, Tie::Constrained aggregates the variable with
a user-defined validity test and handler for failed tests. The interface
is deliberately low-level, with a dummy test and an exception-model
fail handler as defaults.

Tie-Constrained is fully usable as it is, but is easily subclassed to
specialize the default handlers or to modify the runtime behavior.

See the pod for usage details. A cookbook and examples are in the works.
